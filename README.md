### `~/.dotfiles`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gapurov/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles && cd ~/.dotfiles  && sudo ./install.sh
```

#### Install script

**At your own risk**: Review `install.sh`, edit to your requirements, and execute it. It will install dependencies via Homebrew, load iterm settings, symlink various dotfiles to your home directory, and configure tmux, vim etc.
